# MarioKartAdvanceDecomp

A pret styled decompilation of Mario Kart Super Circuit for the GBA.

This is only at its disassembly phase and very much a WIP. The project setup is fully based on YamaArashi's work on his original pokeemerald decompilation project.


## Building

Running build.bat will generate the JPN version. The JPN version is chosen to u-include all the Mobile Adapter GB functionalities.
An original JPN rom is required to build the rom. The build tools are from DevKitARM.


## Info & Contributions

This project is used for me to learn and practice disassembly & decompilation projects on how they work and what actions are needed to be taken in different situations.
Contributions are definitely welcome as I'm really new to this and not fully sure yet how this whole disassembly/decompilation developement works. :-)
